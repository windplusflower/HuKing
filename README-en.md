## Introduction
**Hu King** is a complete overhaul mod for the Elder Hu boss fight in Hollow Knight. This mod reimagines the original encounter into a creative and challenging multi-phase battle, integrating various classic gaming mechanics.

## Core Skills
In this mod, Elder Hu features five distinct attack patterns:

1. **Sawblade Maze**
   - Creates a complex maze of sawblades in the arena, testing the player's movement precision and reaction time.
2. **Laser Flight (Bird Style & Lasers)**
   - Players must navigate vertically through gaps between oscillating pillars while dodging deadly, **thick yellow laser beams**.
3. **Needle Square**
   - Traps the Knight within a square boundary and launches a barrage of **needles** from all directions.
4. **Pinball**
   - Launches sawblades that bounce off walls at high speeds; players must hit the boss with them while avoiding being hit themselves.
5. **Match-Three Challenge**
   - **Mechanic**: Colored sawblades (Bright Red, Yellow, Blue) fall from the ceiling.
   - **Interaction**: Players must hit the falling sawblades to snap them smoothly into the grid on the right.
   - **Elimination**: Matching three sawblades of the same color triggers an elimination, clearing the path to the boss.
6. The Knight is restricted in this mod: Nail Arts are disabled, and Spells deal no damage.
7. Health pools: **Attuned**: 10 | **Ascended**: 15 | **Radiant**: 15.

## Requirements
⚠️ **IMPORTANT:**
- This mod requires the **[Satchel](https://github.com/PrashantMohta/Satchel)** library.
- **A recent version of Satchel is required.** Because this mod utilizes updated APIs, older versions of Satchel will cause skills to fail or the game to crash.
